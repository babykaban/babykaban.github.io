My name is Paul, and I was born in Ukraine. From an early age, I was interested in computers and anything related to them. At the age of 13-14, I started learning programming using the old PascalABC.

Some time later, I began experimenting with microcontrollers, particularly Arduino, and then shifted my attention to the Python programming language. From that moment, my programming journey truly began. At the age of 16, I moved to Canada and started learning 'real' programming. I always wanted to make a game but didn't know anything about the industry. After a while of playing with C/C++ programming languages, I discovered an awesome series called Handmade Hero by Casey Muratori, a professional game programmer. This series not only teaches you how to make a game and what it involves, but Casey did an excellent job explaining how and why particular pieces of code work.

I started the series from the beginning and was very confused because I didn't understand anything, and furthermore, I didn't know much about programming at that time. However, around day 100 of the series, my own ideas started to appear, and I finally decided to make a game.

After a long journey of Casey's explanations and understanding what the code is actually doing, I began writing my own engine and game using the code and knowledge I gained from the series. At the time I started the series, there were around 500 episodes, and of course, I watched them during development to improve my engine and game.

After two years of learning the code and the game industry, I was able to develop my first prototype and even had the opportunity to showcase it at a school exhibition. Now, I continue working on my game and continuously improving my programming skills.

By the way, the game's name is Spellweaver Saga: Retrieving The Legendary Relic.
