## Concept Statement
"Spellweaver Saga: Retrieving The Legendary Relic": is a magical fantasy adventure set in an open-world 
environment reminiscent of the Middle Ages. Player combines magic elements to cast spells, explore 
different locations, and interact with various creatures and mystical entities.

## Main concept
The main concept of the game is Magic-Crafting System which allows player to combine magical elements to create spells, 
making every interaction unique and engaging. The idea came from the DOTA 2 character called Invoker, his main ability is
to combine magic spheres to cast different spells. 

## Storyline
The protagonist embarks on a quest to find an ancient artifact to protect his village. This artifact was extensively 
researched by his mentor, who has mysteriously disappeared. Overall the story looks simple but I still divided it into few acts.

## Gameplay Elements
As I steted above the main gameplay element will be magic-crafting system, however the other like NPCs, quests, real-time combats.

## Visual Style
I had a long thinking process on what art style I want to use, but just out of simplicity decided to use pixel art with a vibrant 
color palette, detailed environments, and distinct colors for different spells and elements.

## Current Status
I have made a prototype with a basic map layout, few quests, and of course the main mechanic of the game.
